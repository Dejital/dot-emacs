Select anything. In Lisp program, some optional arguments can be used.

PLIST is a list like (:key1 val1 :key2 val2 ...) or
 (&optional sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap).

Basic keywords are the following:

- :sources

  Temporary value of `anything-sources'.  It also accepts a
  symbol, interpreted as a variable of an anything source.  It
  also accepts an alist representing an anything source, which is
  detected by (assq 'name ANY-SOURCES)

- :input

  Temporary value of `anything-pattern', ie. initial input of minibuffer.

- :prompt

  Prompt other than \"pattern: \".

- :resume

  If t, Resurrect previously instance of `anything'. Skip the initialization.
  If 'noresume, this instance of `anything' cannot be resumed.

- :preselect

  Initially selected candidate. Specified by exact candidate or a regexp.
  Note that it is not working with delayed sources.

- :buffer

  `anything-buffer' instead of *anything*.

- :keymap

  `anything-map' for current `anything' session.


Of course, conventional arguments are supported, the two are same.

 (anything :sources sources :input input :prompt prompt :resume resume
           :preselect preselect :buffer buffer :keymap keymap)
 (anything sources input prompt resume preselect buffer keymap)
           

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this anything session.
The `anything-' prefix can be omitted. For example,

 (anything :sources 'anything-c-source-buffers
           :buffer \"*buffers*\" :candidate-number-limit 10)

means starting anything session with `anything-c-source-buffers'
source in *buffers* buffer and set
`anything-candidate-number-limit' to 10 as session local variable.
